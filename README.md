A repo for notes about stuff I learn - Why?

My memory is not what it used to be and I forget things a lotâ€¦
1. I bumped into this [nice article](https://dev.to/aurelio/how-i-remember-everything-i-learn-19mi)
2. That took me to this [cool repo](https://github.com/nobitagit/knowledge)
3. That took me to this [very cool repo](https://github.com/RichardLitt/meta-knowledge)

I'll be adding my onw stuff here...
